# Quiz with Graphics

For my final project, I decided to create a graphics interface for one of my projects from Module 2. This way, I have
used ideas from two Modules (Module 2 and Module 4). In Module 2, we had a project where we created a quiz from
reading in information from a .txt file. This project covered topics such as I/O and inheritance which I used for this
project. I used the graphics topics from Module 4.

However, this project just ran in the console. Having now had experience with graphics in Module 4, I thought it would
be more engaging for the user if they could see a graphics window, in which they could interact with. I doubled the
length of the quiz and created clickable buttons and various "screens" to handle each quiz question.

To begin, the user must press the `b` key. Then, the first question will be displayed with the answer choices. The score
is shown in the top right corner. If the mouse hovers over an answer, the color goes slightly darker to show this
interaction. The user chooses an answer by left-clicking an answer. Depending on whether they were right or wrong,
the answer box will change to green or red and the score will be updating before moving to the next question.

Finally, when the quiz is complete, the final score is displayed so the user can see how they did.
